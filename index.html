				<h2>Projects</h2>
				<p>
					Here are some of the projects I have worked on in and school and as an intern.
					The GitHub repositories for these projects are linked so that you may examine these projects and
					run them locally for you to see the magic!

				<div class="container">
					<h3>Tweeter</h3>
					<img src="images/TweeterScreenshot.png" alt="Tweeter project overview." />
					<p>
						A project from CS290 at Oregon State. 
						This site was also reworked to use handlebars and be served using Node.js.
						In it's most current version, it has been reworked and improved upon to utilize
						React. 
					</p>

					<h3>IndowÂ® Windows</h3>
					<img src="images/IndowHomePageScreenshot.png" alt="Indow windows homepage overview." />
					<p>
						I spent the summer of 2021 in the <a href="https://www.emergingleaderspdx.org/" target="_blank">Emerging Leaders</a> 
						cohort interning with Indow to help recreate their <a href="https://indowwindows.com/" target="_blank">company website</a> 
						using <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev/" target="_blank">SvelteKit</a>.
					</p>
					<a href="https://indowwindows.com/" target="_blank"><button>Take me to Indow!</button></a>

					<h3>SvelteKit Calendar</h3>
					<img src="images/comingSoon.webp" alt="This is a project coming soon." />
					<p>
						This project is will be completed during the spring of 2022.
						Primarily utilizing what I have learned through my internship with Indow, and
						some other things learned along the way, SvelteKit Calendar will be a reactive 
						daily planner.
