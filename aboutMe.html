                            Hi! I'm Daniel Valadez--currently a student at Oregon State University. I'm slated to wrap up my undergrad at
                            OSU December 2022! I'll be graduating with a Bachelor's of Sciences in Computer Science with a minor in Business. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During my time at Oregon State, I've enjoyed learning about web development in particular.
                            Here is a <a href="https://github.com/Daniel-Valadez?tab=repositories">link to my GitHub</a>, 
                            where I have a combination of school work and other projects on display.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In my free time, I enjoy walking my dog (he's almost a year old), watching football, and writing. 
                            I look forward to hearing from you, and you can reach me via email at danielvaladez2017@gmail.com. 
                        </p>
